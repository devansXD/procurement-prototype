    <h1>Onboarding flow and homepage iterations</h1>
    
    <p class="nhsuk-body-l">We explored how we could accommodate submitting evaluations to the platform, in user friendly formats</p>

     <p class="nhsuk-body-s nhsuk-u-secondary-text-color">Date: January 2026 | Phase: Alpha Sprint 3</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>


    <p>We initially explored a simple flow which would enable procurement professionals to submit their own evaluations. This would potentially save time
    for trusts looking to share their experiences with products, and help populate the platform with more peer-to-peer intelligence.</p>
    </p>

    

    <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
      <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds">

        
            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Document upload</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Share existing evaluations quickly with minimal data entry</p>
            <p><strong>User journey:</strong></p>
            <ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
              <li>Upload existing evaluation document</li>
              <li>Add basic metadata (product name, supplier, evaluation date)</li>
              <li>Answer 4 quick questions about the evaluation</li>
              <li>Optionally provide contact details for peer discussions</li>
            </ol>
          
            <p><strong>Potential needs met:</strong> Trusts with existing evaluation processes who want to share findings and access others' work without restructuring their current approach</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Key design decisions</h3>

  
    <p>Information feeds into a single shared repository, capturing essential metadata without buredn.</p>

    
    <p>Rather than asking trusts to re-enter information already in their documents, we would ask:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>What type of evaluation was this?</li>
      <li>Did you procure this product? (yes, no, under review)</li>
      <li>Brief description of your evaluation process (optional, 300 characters)</li>
      <li>Are you willing to be contacted by other trusts?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Discussion topics help peer matching</h4>
    <p>If users consent to contact, we ask what topics they're comfortable discussing (implementation, clinical outcomes, supplier experience). This helps other trusts identify the right person to contact for their specific questions.</p>

    <h4>Multi-product evaluations supported</h4>
    <p>Recognising that trusts often evaluate multiple products in comparative assessments, we designed Route A to handle one document linked to multiple product evaluations—avoiding the need to upload the same PDF repeatedly.</p>



    

    <h2>How it tested</h2>

    <p>Summary:</p>
