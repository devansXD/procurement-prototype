    <h1>Onboarding flow and evaluation upload</h1>
    
    <p class="nhsuk-body-l">We explored how we could accommodate submitting evaluations to the platform, in user friendly formats</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>


    <p>We initially explored a simple flow with a basic upload function which would enable procurement professionals to submit their own evaluations. This would potentially save time
    for trusts looking to share their experiences with products, and help populate the platform with more peer-to-peer intelligence.</p>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Document upload</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Share existing evaluations quickly with minimal data entry</p>
            <p><strong>User journey:</strong></p>
            <ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
              <li>Upload existing evaluation document</li>
              <li>Add basic metadata (product name, supplier, evaluation date)</li>
              <li>Answer 4 quick questions about the evaluation</li>
              <li>Optionally provide contact details for peer discussions</li>
            </ol>
          
            <p><strong>Potential needs met:</strong> Trusts with existing evaluation processes who want to share findings and access others' work without restructuring their current approach</p>

    <h3>Key design decisions</h3>

  
    <p>Information feeds into a single shared repository, capturing essential metadata without buredn.</p>

    
    <p>Rather than asking trusts to re-enter information already in their documents, we would ask:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>What type of evaluation was this?</li>
      <li>Did you procure this product? (yes, no, under review)</li>
      <li>Brief description of your evaluation process (optional, 300 characters)</li>
      <li>Are you willing to be contacted by other trusts?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Discussion topics help peer matching</h4>
    <p>If users consent to contact, we ask what topics they're comfortable discussing (implementation, clinical outcomes, supplier experience). This helps other trusts identify the right person to contact for their specific questions.</p>

    <h4>Multi-product evaluations supported</h4>
    <p>Recognising that trusts often evaluate multiple products in comparative assessments,from user research findings, we designed another iteration which allows handling of one document linked to multiple product evaluations—avoiding the need to upload the same PDF repeatedly.</p>

      <figure class="nhsuk-image">
  <img src="/images/dh-3-doc-upload-multiple.png" alt="image of the second iteration of the document upload flow, which supports multiple products per document"> <figcaption class="nhsuk-image__caption">Multi-product document upload page</figcaption> </figure> <h2>How it looks now</h2> <p>We iterated on the design to better meet user needs and feedback, while still aligning with our core principles of simplicity and ease of use.</p>
  <figcaption class="nhsuk-image__caption"> Another iteration of the document upload page for multiple product support</figcaption>
</figure>

    

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">How it tested</h2>

    

    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Users recognised the need to share multiple products and the importance of providing context around their evaluations (for example, department and scale information).</li>
       <li>At least one participant flagged a concern that breaches of confidentiality could occur when sharing evaluations</li>
        <li>Users raised risks of misunderstandings around words like “evaluation”, “study” and “trial”, which have context-specific connotations.</li>
        <li>Users had insights about friction they might experience when filling in the fields on this page, including that an evaluation lead may not always be a clinician; that the date of an evaluation may sometimes we difficult to pinpoint.</li>
    <li>Users showed interest in understanding why a trust did NOT procure a product.</li>
      </ul>
