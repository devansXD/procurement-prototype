    <h1>Designing the dual pathway approach for trust evaluation submission</h1>
    
    <p class="nhsuk-body-l">We explored how to accommodate different trust maturity levels through two distinct routes for submitting evaluations to the platform.</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>

    <p>During early discovery, we identified a tension in how NHS trusts approach procurement evaluations:</p>

    <p>Some trusts have well-established evaluation processes and produce comprehensive assessment documents as part of their normal workflow. These trusts wanted a quick way to share existing work without duplicating effort.</p>

    <p>Other trusts wanted guidance and structure—either because they were less mature in their procurement processes or because they wanted to ensure their evaluations were comprehensive and comparable.</p>

    <p>A one-size-fits-all approach would either be too burdensome for trusts with existing evaluations (requiring them to re-enter data they've already documented) or too unstructured for trusts wanting guidance (leaving them without a framework).</p>

    <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
      <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
      <p>"So there will not be any consistency (initially) across the documents that users make available to us. This might be a large clinical trial over some months, or just a one-pager showing the result of one clinician sitting down to try something out."</p>
    </div>

    <p>We needed a model that embraced this variety rather than forcing artificial standardisation that would discourage participation.</p>

    <h2>Design solution</h2>

    <p>We designed a dual pathway approach with two distinct routes:</p>

    <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
      <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-one-half">
        <div class="nhsuk-card">
          <div class="nhsuk-card__content">
            <h3 class="nhsuk-card__heading">Route A: Quick document upload</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Share existing evaluations quickly with minimal data entry</p>
            <p><strong>User journey:</strong></p>
            <ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
              <li>Upload existing evaluation document</li>
              <li>Add basic metadata (product name, supplier, evaluation date)</li>
              <li>Answer 4 quick questions about the evaluation</li>
              <li>Optionally provide contact details for peer discussions</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 5-10 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Trusts with existing evaluation processes who want to share findings and access others' work without restructuring their current approach</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-one-half">
        <div class="nhsuk-card">
          <div class="nhsuk-card__content">
            <h3 class="nhsuk-card__heading">Route B: Structured assessment</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Comprehensive product evaluation using a standardised framework</p>
            <p><strong>User journey:</strong></p>
            <ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
              <li>Select product and begin structured evaluation</li>
              <li>Complete assessment sections (clinical value, safety, integration, sustainability)</li>
              <li>Add supporting evidence and documentation</li>
              <li>Review and submit</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 30-45 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Trusts wanting to conduct thorough evaluations using a standardised framework, or those seeking detailed product comparisons</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Key design decisions</h3>

    <h4>Both routes feed the same repository</h4>
    <p>Regardless of which pathway trusts choose, all product intelligence feeds into a single shared repository. Route A users benefit from Route B's structured data, and Route B users can access Route A's shared documents.</p>

    <h4>Route A captures essential metadata without burden</h4>
    <p>Rather than asking trusts to re-enter information already in their documents, we ask four focused questions:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>What type of evaluation was this? (clinical trial, pilot, usage report, quick review)</li>
      <li>Did you procure this product? (yes, no, under review)</li>
      <li>Brief description of your evaluation process (optional, 300 characters)</li>
      <li>Are you willing to be contacted by other trusts?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Discussion topics help peer matching</h4>
    <p>If users consent to contact, we ask what topics they're comfortable discussing (implementation, clinical outcomes, supplier experience). This helps other trusts identify the right person to contact for their specific questions.</p>

    <h4>Multi-product evaluations supported</h4>
    <p>Recognising that trusts often evaluate multiple products in comparative assessments, we designed Route A to handle one document linked to multiple product evaluations—avoiding the need to upload the same PDF repeatedly.</p>

    <h3>Visual design</h3>

    <p>The pathway selection screen uses clear iconography and time estimates to help users self-select:</p>

    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Route A shown with a document upload icon and "5-10 minutes"</li>
      <li>Route B shown with a structured form icon and "30-45 minutes"</li>
      <li>Guidance text explains who each route is best suited for</li>
      <li>Users can switch between routes if they change their mind</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it tested</h2>

    <p>We tested the dual pathway concept with procurement professionals across different trust sizes and maturity levels:</p>

    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Users intuitively understood the difference between routes and could self-select appropriately</li>
      <li>Trusts with existing evaluation documents appreciated Route A's minimal burden: "I've already done the work—I just want to share it"</li>
      <li>Users liked that Route A still captured key metadata: "This asks the right questions without being onerous"</li>
      <li>The discussion topics feature was well-received: "This means people won't just contact me about anything—they'll know what I can help with"</li>
      <li>Some users said they might start with Route A for speed, then return to complete Route B for important products</li>
      <li>The convergence into a single repository was important: "I don't want to have to check two different places"</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
      <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
      <p><strong>Questions and concerns raised:</strong></p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>How do we ensure Route A evaluations are high enough quality to be useful? (We decided trust-level curation was preferable to platform-level gatekeeping)</li>
        <li>Will Route B completion rates suffer if Route A is available? (To be monitored in beta)</li>
        <li>Should we prompt Route A users to consider Route B for products they care most about? (Potentially, but not initially)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>

    <p>Based on testing, we will:</p>

    <ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
      <li>Proceed with the dual pathway model for alpha</li>
      <li>Monitor usage patterns to understand the split between routes</li>
      <li>Iterate on Route A's metadata questions based on what proves most useful for peer matching</li>
      <li>Develop guidance materials for Route B to support trusts new to structured evaluation</li>
      <li>Test whether users successfully navigate between routes and whether the "meeting users where they are" principle translates to actual adoption</li>
    </ol>
