    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Information architecture</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Designing search for four modes of information seeking</h3>
    <p class="nhsuk-body-s nhsuk-u-secondary-text-color">Based on Donna Spencer's framework</p>

    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>Our original search page failed to support the different ways NHS procurement users seek information. Some users know exactly what they want, others are exploring options, some don't know what questions to ask, and others are trying to find something they've seen before.</p>

    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We restructured the search landing page to support all four information-seeking modes:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Known-item seeking:</strong> Prominent search box with manufacturer/product/GMDN support, and quick links</li>
      <li><strong>Exploratory seeking:</strong> Six category cards showing product counts AND trust evaluation counts</li>
      <li><strong>Don't know what you need to know:</strong> Educational cards ('What makes good evidence?', 'Questions to ask other trusts', 'Value-based procurement explained')</li>
      <li><strong>Re-finding:</strong> 'Your recent activity' section showing recently viewed products and saved comparisons when signed in</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Key insight</h4>
    <p>Procurement users often think they're doing known-item search ('I need product X') but actually need exploratory support ('what are trusts finding works?') or guidance ('what evidence should I even care about?').</p>

    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--m">

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Category results page for exploratory users</h3>

    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>When users selected a category to explore (e.g. 'Wound care'), we needed a results page that supported discovery rather than just listing products.</p>

    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We designed the category results page with:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Category-level stats:</strong> '183 products from 47 suppliers · 56 NHS trust evaluations · 23 trusts available to contact'</li>
      <li><strong>Filters that teach:</strong> Product types, evidence types, and peer availability help users learn the domain as they narrow down</li>
      <li><strong>Default sort by 'Most trusts using':</strong> Social proof first for discovery-oriented users</li>
      <li><strong>Peer contact indicator:</strong> '5 trusts willing to discuss lessons learned' on each product card</li>
      <li><strong>Comparison checkboxes:</strong> Sticky selection bar appears when products selected</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Rationale</h4>
    <p>Exploratory users' needs change as they discover. The page supports the journey from 'what's out there?' through filtering, scanning trust adoption, to selecting products for comparison.</p>

    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--l nhsuk-section-break--visible">

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Product page</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What we changed</h3>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Charts first:</strong> Three clickable summary charts immediately after product header (trial outcomes donut, regional bar chart, contacts ring)</li>
      <li><strong>Charts by region:</strong> Regional breakdown with clickable cards for North West, London, Midlands, South East</li>
      <li><strong>Clickable trusts:</strong> Every trust card is now a full clickable link to a trust detail page</li>
      <li><strong>Total cost of ownership breakdown:</strong> New section with cost table and projected annual savings by trust size</li>
      <li><strong>'Trial' terminology:</strong> Changed 'evaluation' to 'trial' throughout (e.g. '18 NHS trusts have trialled this product')</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What we kept</h4>
    <p>Supplier contact card in sidebar, technical specs in accordion, cost details in accordion, contact details in cards with discussion topics.</p>

      <img src="/images/dh-4-product-page.png" alt="image of the product page with new charts and regional breakdown">

    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--l nhsuk-section-break--visible">

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Content design</h2>

    <p>At this stage, a content designer performed a content review and made minor changes based on insights from user research transcripts, discussions about service functionality with team members, GDS content design guidelines and NHS style guidelines.</p>

    <p>This included:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>clearer calls to action on some pages, to avoid confusion</li>
      <li>consistency and accuracy of language throughout</li>
      <li>colour coding of tags being limited to procurement decisions only (given confusion from users and potential for mixed meaning)</li>
      <li>reduced text in some places to simplify, communicate key points more clearly and avoid redundancy</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ============ USER RESEARCH FINDINGS ============ -->
    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">User research</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Selected user research insights</h3>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>The section about the NHS 10-year plan confused some users as they weren't sure of its relevance.</li>
      <li>Users were generally positive about the benefits-related text on the homepage.</li>
      <li>Evaluation uploading was mostly considered straightforward, but research highlighted the fact that it only covered "evaluations" and not other types of documents.</li>
      <li>Users felt the filters would be useful, especially filtering based on trust type and product category.</li>
      <li>Users liked the badges but were sometimes unclear on the colour system.</li>
    </ul>
