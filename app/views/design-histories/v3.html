    <!-- ============ INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE ============ -->
    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Information architecture</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Designing search for four modes of information seeking</h3>
    <p class="nhsuk-body-s nhsuk-u-secondary-text-color">Based on Donna Spencer's framework</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>Our original search page only had a data sources card and failed to support the different ways NHS procurement users seek information. Some users know exactly what they want, others are exploring options, some don't know what questions to ask, and others are trying to find something they've seen before.</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We restructured the search page to support all four information-seeking modes:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Known-item seeking:</strong> Prominent search box with manufacturer/product/GMDN support, plus 'Recently searched across NHS' quick links</li>
      <li><strong>Exploratory seeking:</strong> Six category cards showing product counts AND trust evaluation counts as social proof</li>
      <li><strong>Don't know what you need to know:</strong> Educational cards ('What makes good evidence?', 'Questions to ask other trusts', 'Value-based procurement explained')</li>
      <li><strong>Re-finding:</strong> 'Your recent activity' section showing recently viewed products and saved comparisons when signed in</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Key insight</h4>
    <p>Procurement users often think they're doing known-item search ('I need product X') but actually need exploratory support ('what are trusts finding works?') or guidance ('what evidence should I even care about?'). The page now supports all paths without forcing users to self-identify.</p>

    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--m">

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Category results page for exploratory users</h3>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>When users selected a category to explore (e.g. 'Wound care'), we needed a results page that supported discovery rather than just listing products.</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We designed the category results page with:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Category-level stats:</strong> '183 products from 47 suppliers · 56 NHS trust evaluations · 23 trusts available to contact'</li>
      <li><strong>Filters that teach:</strong> Product types, evidence types, and peer availability help users learn the domain as they narrow down</li>
      <li><strong>Default sort by 'Most trusts using':</strong> Social proof first for discovery-oriented users</li>
      <li><strong>Peer contact indicator:</strong> '5 trusts willing to discuss lessons learned' on each product card</li>
      <li><strong>Comparison checkboxes:</strong> Sticky selection bar appears when products selected</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Rationale</h4>
    <p>Exploratory users' needs change as they discover. The page supports the journey from 'what's out there?' through filtering, scanning trust adoption, to selecting products for comparison.</p>

    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--l nhsuk-section-break--visible">

    <!-- ============ PRODUCT PAGES ============ -->
    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Product pages</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Leading with trust adoption visibility</h3>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>User research revealed NHS procurement professionals rely heavily on informal personal networks to discover what other trusts are procuring. Our initial product page design followed a conventional pattern: supplier branding and marketing content at the top, trust evaluations buried lower as supporting content. This didn't reflect how users actually make decisions.</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We restructured product pages to prioritise peer intelligence:</p>
    <ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
      <li><strong>Trust adoption section moved to hero position:</strong> '12 NHS trusts have evaluated this product' with outcomes (9 procured, 2 under review, 1 excluded)</li>
      <li><strong>Featured contact cards:</strong> 'Sarah is happy to discuss: implementation, clinical outcomes, supplier experience'</li>
      <li><strong>'How they evaluated' sections:</strong> Shows process, business case approach, and decision factors</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation type badges:</strong> Clinical trial, pilot study, usage report, quick review</li>
      <li><strong>Technical details collapsed:</strong> Specifications and cost analysis in expandable accordions</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What we removed</h4>
    <p><strong>Star rating reviews section:</strong> User research showed users prefer talking to people over reading reviews. The evaluation cards with contacts serve this need better.</p>

    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--m">

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Iterating based on user feedback</h3>
    <p class="nhsuk-body-s nhsuk-u-secondary-text-color">Wound care product page iteration</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">User feedback</h4>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>'The first thing I would see is a chart across all these responses and then click on it if I want more information'</li>
      <li>'Charts summarising the information based on the areas and people I know'</li>
      <li>'It would be useful to click on these Trusts'</li>
      <li>'Maybe a breakdown of the total cost of ownership would be helpful'</li>
      <li>'Trial is better than evaluation'</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design changes</h4>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Charts first:</strong> Three clickable summary charts immediately after product header (trial outcomes donut, regional bar chart, contacts ring)</li>
      <li><strong>Charts by region:</strong> Regional breakdown with clickable cards for North West, London, Midlands, South East</li>
      <li><strong>Clickable trusts:</strong> Every trust card is now a full clickable link to a trust detail page</li>
      <li><strong>Total cost of ownership breakdown:</strong> New section with cost table and projected annual savings by trust size</li>
      <li><strong>'Trial' terminology:</strong> Changed 'evaluation' to 'trial' throughout (e.g. '18 NHS trusts have trialled this product')</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Retained from previous design</h4>
    <p>Supplier contact card in sidebar, technical specs in accordion, cost details in accordion, contact details in cards with discussion topics.</p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">User research findings</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Key insights from procurement research</h3>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What users told us</h4>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Nearly all users want to know what other Trusts are procuring and using, but their current mechanism is ad-hoc and based on informal personal networks</li>
      <li>Users want to know not just about the product itself, but how another Trust did the evaluation, made a business case, and what factors they considered important</li>
      <li>The value is not primarily about saving time/avoiding trials, but about building confidence that a product is a viable option</li>
      <li>Most of what we heard was about the 'shortlisting' stage of procurement</li>
      <li>Users would always prefer to talk to someone in another Trust than to rely on written information alone</li>
      <li>Nearly no users thought there would be any issue with sharing their evaluations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Implications for design</h4>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Trust adoption as hero:</strong> Make 'which trusts are using this' the first thing users see</li>
      <li><strong>Peer contact facilitation:</strong> Enable and encourage trust-to-trust contact</li>
      <li><strong>'Lessons learned' framing:</strong> Frame contact around lessons learned rather than technical information</li>
      <li><strong>Show discussion topics:</strong> Increase likelihood of peer contact by showing what each person will discuss</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Final iteration gaps identified</h3>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Gaps to address</h4>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Value for money dimensions:</strong> Procurement measures value against social value, total product life, clinical results, patient outcomes — not just price</li>
      <li><strong>Safety prominence for clinicians:</strong> Clinical staff prioritise safety and co-production more than procurement staff</li>
      <li><strong>Support for interpreting information:</strong> Teams are often unable to understand what data means without explanation</li>
      <li><strong>Trust capacity context:</strong> Show 500 vs 200 beds to help users assess relevance to their situation</li>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Dual pathway approach for evaluation submission</h3>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>We identified a tension in how NHS trusts approach evaluations. Some have well-established processes and produce comprehensive documents; they want to share existing work without duplicating effort. Others want guidance and structure. A one-size-fits-all approach would be too burdensome for mature trusts or too unstructured for others.</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We designed a dual pathway approach:</p>

          <li>Answer 4 quick questions about the evaluation</li>
          <li>Optionally provide contact details for peer discussions</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nhsuk-body-s nhsuk-u-secondary-text-color">Time to complete: 5–10 minutes</p>

    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Both routes feed the same repository:</strong> Route A users benefit from Route B's structured data, and vice versa</li>
      <li><strong>Route A captures essential metadata without burden:</strong> Evaluation type, procurement outcome, brief process description, contact willingness</li>
      <li><strong>Discussion topics help peer matching:</strong> If users consent to contact, we ask what topics they're comfortable discussing</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-product evaluations supported:</strong> One document can link to multiple product evaluations</li>

      <li>Users intuitively understood the difference between routes and could self-select appropriately</li>
      <li>Trusts with existing documents appreciated Route A's minimal burden</li>
      <li>The discussion topics feature was well-received: 'People won't just contact me about anything — they'll know what I can help with'</li>
      <li>Some users said they might start with Route A for speed, then return to complete Route B for important products</li>
