    <!-- ============ INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE ============ -->
    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Information architecture</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Designing search for four modes of information seeking</h3>
    <p class="nhsuk-body-s nhsuk-u-secondary-text-color">Based on Donna Spencer's framework</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>Our original search page failed to support the different ways NHS procurement users seek information. Some users know exactly what they want, others are exploring options, some don't know what questions to ask, and others are trying to find something they've seen before.</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We restructured the search page to support all four information-seeking modes:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Known-item seeking:</strong> Prominent search box with manufacturer/product/GMDN support, plus 'Recently searched across NHS' quick links</li>
      <li><strong>Exploratory seeking:</strong> Six category cards showing product counts AND trust evaluation counts as social proof</li>
      <li><strong>Don't know what you need to know:</strong> Educational cards ('What makes good evidence?', 'Questions to ask other trusts', 'Value-based procurement explained')</li>
      <li><strong>Re-finding:</strong> 'Your recent activity' section showing recently viewed products and saved comparisons when signed in</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Key insight</h4>
    <p>Procurement users often think they're doing known-item search ('I need product X') but actually need exploratory support ('what are trusts finding works?') or guidance ('what evidence should I even care about?'). The page now supports all paths without forcing users to self-identify.</p>

    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--m">

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Category results page for exploratory users</h3>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>When users selected a category to explore (e.g. 'Wound care'), we needed a results page that supported discovery rather than just listing products.</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We designed the category results page with:</p>
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Category-level stats:</strong> '183 products from 47 suppliers · 56 NHS trust evaluations · 23 trusts available to contact'</li>
      <li><strong>Filters that teach:</strong> Product types, evidence types, and peer availability help users learn the domain as they narrow down</li>
      <li><strong>Default sort by 'Most trusts using':</strong> Social proof first for discovery-oriented users</li>
      <li><strong>Peer contact indicator:</strong> '5 trusts willing to discuss lessons learned' on each product card</li>
      <li><strong>Comparison checkboxes:</strong> Sticky selection bar appears when products selected</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Rationale</h4>
    <p>Exploratory users' needs change as they discover. The page supports the journey from 'what's out there?' through filtering, scanning trust adoption, to selecting products for comparison.</p>

    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--l nhsuk-section-break--visible">

    <!-- ============ PRODUCT PAGES ============ -->
    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Product pages</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Leading with trust adoption visibility</h3>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">The problem</h4>
    <p>User research revealed NHS procurement professionals rely heavily on informal personal networks to discover what other trusts are procuring. Our initial product page design followed a conventional pattern: supplier branding and marketing content at the top, trust evaluations buried lower as supporting content. This didn't reflect how users actually make decisions.</p>
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Design solution</h4>
    <p>We restructured product pages to prioritise peer intelligence:</p>
    <ol class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--number">
      <li><strong>Trust adoption section moved to hero position:</strong> '12 NHS trusts have evaluated this product' with outcomes (9 procured, 2 under review, 1 excluded)</li>
      <li><strong>Featured contact cards:</strong> 'Sarah is happy to discuss: implementation, clinical outcomes, supplier experience'</li>
      <li><strong>'How they evaluated' sections:</strong> Shows process, business case approach, and decision factors</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation type badges:</strong> Clinical trial, pilot study, usage report, quick review</li>
      <li><strong>Technical details collapsed:</strong> Specifications and cost analysis in expandable accordions</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--m">

<h3>What else we changed</h3>

<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list-bullet">

     <li><strong>Charts first:</strong> Three clickable summary charts immediately after product header (trial outcomes donut, regional bar chart, contacts ring)</li>
      <li><strong>Charts by region:</strong> Regional breakdown with clickable cards for North West, London, Midlands, South East</li>
      <li><strong>Clickable trusts:</strong> Every trust card is now a full clickable link to a trust detail page</li>
      <li><strong>Total cost of ownership breakdown:</strong> New section with cost table and projected annual savings by trust size</li>
      <li><strong>'Trial' terminology:</strong> Changed 'evaluation' to 'trial' throughout (e.g. '18 NHS trusts have trialled this product')</li>
</ul>
    
  
    
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">What we kept</h4>
    <p>Supplier contact card in sidebar, technical specs in accordion, cost details in accordion, contact details in cards with discussion topics.</p>
