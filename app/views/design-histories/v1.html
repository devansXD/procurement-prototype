    <h2>The problem</h2>

    <p>User research revealed that NHS procurement professionals rely heavily on informal personal networks to discover what other trusts are procuring and using. However, this mechanism is ad-hoc and limited to who they happen to know.</p>

    <p>Our initial product page design followed a conventional pattern: supplier branding and marketing content at the top, technical specifications prominent, and trust evaluations buried lower in the page as supporting content. This didn't reflect how users actually make procurement decisions.</p>

    

  
        

            <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Key Insights</h2>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Peer intelligence is valued but currently ad-hoc</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Nearly all users want to know what other Trusts are procuring and using</li>
                <li>Current mechanisms are ad-hoc and based on informal personal networks</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Users want context beyond product performance</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Users want to understand not just how well a product was evaluated, but how the evaluation was conducted</li>
                <li>Interest in how other Trusts built business cases and what factors they considered important</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Value is about confidence, not time-saving</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>The primary value isn't avoiding trials or saving time</li>
                <li>It's about building confidence that a product is a viable option for their Trust</li>
                <li>Most feedback relates to the shortlisting stage where users consider which products and suppliers to explore further</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Willingness to share</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Nearly no users saw any issue with sharing their procurement evaluations with other Trusts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Preference for conversation</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Some users said they would always prefer talking to someone at another Trust over relying on written information alone</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">User Needs</h2>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">1. Building procurement confidence through peer learning</h3>
            <p class="nhsuk-body">Users need to learn what has worked for other Trusts. The information required varies by Trust, product category and individual, but broadly includes:</p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>How has the product worked for the Trust, and what issues did they find</li>
                <li>How has the supplier worked for the Trust, and what issues did they find</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">2. Knowing who to contact</h3>
            <p class="nhsuk-body">Users need to identify which Trusts to talk to and find contact details for people in those Trusts:</p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Whether another Trust has procured or is using a product is key information for choosing who to contact</li>
                <li>Users will also judge how helpful a Trust might be based on their own knowledge</li>
            </ul>

            <hr class="nhsuk-section-break nhsuk-section-break--l nhsuk-section-break--visible">

            <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Service Vision</h2>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Core functionality</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Show which Trusts are using and procuring which medtech</li>
                <li>Enable users to contact people in those Trusts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Evaluation visibility</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Show a broad range of evaluation types from Trusts, associated with products</li>
                <li>This might include large clinical trials over several months, or a simple one-pager from a clinician trying something out</li>
                <li>There will not be consistency (initially) across documents users make available</li>
                <li>We could explore showing key information alongside evaluations (e.g. did the Trust end up procuring or excluding this product)</li>
                <li>This contextual information could be gathered by asking users a few questions when they share a document</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Trusted sources beyond Trusts</h3>
            <p class="nhsuk-body">Some evaluations may come from other trusted bodies our users rely on:</p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>NHS Supply Chain</li>
                <li>NHS-led initiatives like GIRFT</li>
                <li>External NHS-adjacent partners like ODEP</li>
                <li>Any body using clinicians to evaluate devices that our users trust</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Informal feedback (potential)</h3>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Potentially show user feedback not captured in formal documents (e.g. "I had supply chain issues with this supplier")</li>
                <li>Star ratings may not be the right design choice – this needs further exploration</li>
            </ul>


   

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Design solution</h2>

    <p>We fundamentally structured the product page hierarchy to lead with peer information.</p>

    <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
      <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-one-half">
           <img class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-5" src="https://placehold.co/500x400" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-one-half">
           <img class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-5 nhsuk-u-margin-left-2" src="https://placehold.co/500x400" alt="">
      </div>
    </div>

    

    <h3>Featured contact cards</h3>

  
    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Named contact willing to discuss the evaluation</li>
      <li>Their role and trust</li>
      <li>Specific discussion topics they're comfortable covering (implementation, clinical outcomes, supplier experience)</li>
      <li>Clear call-to-action: "Contact Sarah about this evaluation"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Embracing evaluation variety</h3>

    <p>Each evaluation card now displays:</p>

    <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Evaluation type badge: <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--blue">Clinical trial</strong> <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--blue">Pilot study</strong> <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--blue">Usage report</strong> <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--blue">Quick review</strong></li>
      <li>Outcome badge: <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--green">Procured</strong> <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--yellow">Under review</strong> <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--red">Excluded</strong></li>
      <li>Trust type context: <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--grey">Teaching hospital</strong> <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--grey">District general</strong></li>
      <li>"How they evaluated" section describing process, business case approach, and key decision factors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What we removed</h3>

    <p>We removed the star rating review section entirely. Research showed users want conversations and context, not simplified ratings. The nuance of "it worked for us because..." can't be captured in stars.</p>
